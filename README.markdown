# Backbone Reference App

A reference application built on [Backbone][backbone], [Marionette][marionette], and [RequireJS][requirejs] (and also SharePoint, but don't let that scare you away).

There's a double entendre here: it's a reference application in the sense that I'm releasing it to help other developers learn how to structure their applications; but it's also extracted from a whole product line of reference-type applications (phone directories, link pages, etc.) that I'm building for my company's intranet.

## What This Is (and What It Isn't)

This is an example application, more complex than the many To-Do sample apps out there, but still simple enough for one developer to comprehend. I'm putting it out there as a resource.

This is *not* a finished application that you can drop in place and use as-is. You might be able to use it as a kind of boilerplate to jump-start your development, but it's not really done with that in mind. And it's not a library you'll want to build on top of.

I really mean for it to be primarily a learning resource. I learned a *ton* of stuff building it, but I also struggled at times because I couldn't find a resource like this. Hopefully I can smooth out the learning curve for someone else.
